## Derivation Review

### [Chain Rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-2-new/ab-3-1a/v/chain-rule-introduction)

Chain rule is vital in understanding derivation as a whole. the above link is a helpful review of the concept

Essentialy, when you derive something like `(sin(x))^k`, you do the derivative of the sin(x)^k with respect to sin(x), then multiply by the part within the parenthesis (`sin(x)`) with respect to x. this all turns into `2sin(x) * cos(x)`.

* d/dx log(yx) = d/dx log(y) + d/dx log(x) [chain rule] = 0 + 1/x
