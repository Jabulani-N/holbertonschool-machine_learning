## Derivation Review

### [Chain Rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-2-new/ab-3-1a/v/chain-rule-introduction)

Chain rule is vital in understanding derivation as a whole. the above link is a helpful review of the concept

Essentialy, when you derive something like `(sin(x))^k`, you do the derivative of the sin(x)^k with respect to sin(x), then multiply by the part within the parenthesis (`sin(x)`) with respect to x. this all turns into `2sin(x) * cos(x)`.

[Lograrithm derivation](https://brilliant.org/wiki/derivative-of-logarithmic-functions/)

* d/dx log(yx) = d/dx log(y) + d/dx log(x) [chain rule] = 0 + 1/x

* d/dx of xln(x) = ln(x) + 1, having chain ruled  the x*ln(x) by treating "ln(x)" as "k" in the usual derivation formulae, and then adding it to the derivation of x, 1. [citation needed]


## Tasks

### Task7

do not let the second mathematical statement confuse you. it has vital information written in an intimidating way.

* it is saying `d/dx y = 0` and `d/dy x = 0`. This is because if you are not deriving with respect to a given variable, you can treat that variable like a constant. It's what you'll see done with the "k" in derivation charts.
